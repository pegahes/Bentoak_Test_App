# Overview
This repository serves as a demonstration for the CardScan library. [CardScan](https://cardscan.io/) is a relatively small library that provides fast and accurate payment card scanning.

CardScan is the foundation for CardVerify enterprise libraries, which validate the authenticity of payment cards as they are scanned.

## Requirements
* Android API level 21 or higher
* AndroidX compatibility
* Kotlin coroutine compatibility

Note: Your app does not have to be written in kotlin to integrate this library, but must be able to depend on kotlin functionality.

## Demo
This repository contains a demonstration app for the CardScan product. To build and install this library follow the following steps:

1. Clone the repository from github
    ```bash
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/getbouncer/cardscan-demo-android
    ```
    
2. Build the library using gradle or [android studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).
    a. Using android studio, open the directory `cardscan-demo-android`. Install the app on your device or an emulator by clicking the play button in the top right of android studio.
    
    ![build_android_studio](../docs/images/build_android_studio.png)
    
    b. Using gradle, build the demo app by executing the following command:
    
    ```bash
    ./gradlew demo:assembleRelease
    ```
    This will create a release APK in the `cardscan-demo/build/outputs/apk` directory. Copy this file to your device and install it.

## Integration
See the [integration documentation](https://docs.getbouncer.com/card-scan/android-integration-guide/android-development-guide) in the Bouncer Docs.

### Provisioning an API key
CardScan requires a valid API key to run. To provision an API key, visit the [Bouncer API console](https://api.getbouncer.com/console).

### Name and expiration extraction support (BETA)
To test name and/or expiration extraction, please first provision an API key, then reach out to [support@getbouncer.com](mailto:support@getbouncer.com) with details about your use case and estimated volumes.

Before launching the CardScan flow, make sure to call the ```CardScanActivity.warmup()``` function with your API key and set ```initializeNameAndExpiryExtraction``` to ```true```

```kotlin
CardScanActivity.warmup(this, API_KEY, true)
```

## Customizing
CardScan is built to be customized to fit your UI.

### Basic modifications
To modify text, colors, or padding of the default UI, see the [customization](https://docs.getbouncer.com/card-scan/android-integration-guide/android-customization-guide) documentation.

### Extensive modifications
To modify arrangement or UI functionality, CardScan can be used as a library for your custom implementation. See the [example single-activity demo app](demo/src/main/java/com/getbouncer/cardscan/demo/SingleActivityDemo.java).

## Developing
See the [development docs](https://docs.getbouncer.com/card-scan/android-integration-guide/android-development-guide) for details on developing for CardScan.
